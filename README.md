## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project

This project was carried out by Donald Watt as a submission for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' Course Project.

## Data Set

I used the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set'. This is available at: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

## Scripts

This project is comprised of three parts.

*run_analysis.R* - An R script that downloads the raw data set and produces a tidy data set in an external text file. This is achieved by following the five steps described in the project brief.

*CodeBook.md* - A code book file that describes the variables, data, and the transformations performed to clean the data.

*tidy_dataset.txt* - An external text file containing the transformed data set.
